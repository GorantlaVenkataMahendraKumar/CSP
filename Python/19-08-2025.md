## 1.What are the four main pillars of OOP, and can you explain them briefly (excluding polymorphism)?

```python

A.Four Main Pillars of OOP (excluding Polymorphism)
1.Encapsulation:

Bundles data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).

Restricts direct access to some components, enhancing security and modularity.

2.Abstraction:

Hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features.

Helps reduce programming complexity and isolate impact of changes.

3.Inheritance:

Allows a class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent).

Promotes code reuse and hierarchical classification.

4.Polymorphism:

Enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even if they behave differently.
```

## 2.What is the difference between a class and an object?

```python

A.   Class vs Object
Feature	                           Class	                                        Object
Definition	             Blueprint for creating objects	                    Instance of a class
Purpose	                Defines attributes and behaviors	                 Represents a specific entity
Example	                class Car()                                         my_car = Car()
```

## 3.Explain encapsulation with an example.

```python

A.It is the process of bundling attributes and methods within a single unit.
-> Wrapping of the data and methods into a single class/unit is called Encapsulation.

Types of Encapsulation:
1.Public Members: Accessible from anywhere.
2.Protected Members: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
3.Private Members: Accessible only within the class.
```

## 4.How is abstraction implemented in OOP?

```python

A.Providing essentials without providing background details and reusability. 
1. Hiding the data for security.
2. Reducing the complexity.
3. Providing the reusability.
4. Simplify the maintenance.

-> Abstraction helps hides all the irrelevant data to reduce the complexity and to provide the security. This will be achieving using Abstract Method and Abstract      Class.

-> Abstract Method: An Abstract Method is a method only having declaration but not definition(body).

-> Abstract Class: A class contains one or more abstract methods is called abstract class. We can not create object for abstract class.

-> Abstract class will be created from ABC class.

-> Abstract method will be created using @abstractmethod.

-> Once we create a new class from abstract class it is must to write definition to all abstract methods.
```

## 5.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?

```python

A. Aspect	                Encapsulation	                                                        Abstraction
   What	                Hides data	                                                           Hides implementation
   Achieved by	          Access specifiers (private, protected, public)	                       Abstract classes & interfaces
   Purpose	             Protects data, ensures controlled access	                             Shows only essential features
   Example	             Private variables in a class	                                         @abstractmethod in abstract class
```

## 6.What is inheritance in OOP? What types of inheritance are supported in your programming language?

```python

A.Definition: Inheritance allows one class (child/derived) to reuse properties and methods of another class (parent/base).
Types of Inheritance in Python

Single Inheritance → one parent, one child

Multiple Inheritance → child inherits from multiple parents

Multilevel Inheritance → child inherits from a parent, which itself inherits from another

Hierarchical Inheritance → multiple children inherit from the same parent

Hybrid Inheritance → combination of the above
```

## 7.What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?

```python

A.Abstract Class → can have both abstract methods and concrete methods (implemented).

Interface (in Python) → Python doesn’t have a strict interface keyword. But we can create abstract classes with only abstract methods, which act as interfaces.
```

## 8.What is a constructor? How is it different from a normal method?

```python

A. Definition: A constructor (__init__) is a special method that runs automatically when an object is created.
Difference from normal method:

Constructor runs automatically at object creation

Normal methods must be called explicitly
```

## 9.What is the difference between a constructor and a destructor?

```python

A.Constructor (__init__) → Initializes object when created

Destructor (__del__) → Called when object is destroyed (rarely used in Python, as garbage collector handles it).
```

## 10.Can you explain access specifiers (public, private, protected) and their role in OOP?

```python

A. Unlike Java/C++, Python doesn’t enforce strict access control but follows conventions:

Public (var) → accessible everywhere

Protected (_var) → should not be accessed outside class (convention only)

Private (__var) → name mangling makes it harder to access
```
